# PJ Slider
Simple Wordpress Slideshow plugin using owl carousel. 

Actually I was trying to find a wordpress plugin that will work like the jQuery Hero Carousel. But Could not find any.
So I decided to build one by myself.

Used famouse owl carousel for the main slider script.

You can add sliders ( slideshow category )  and Slides.

Wordpress Shortcode is [pj_slider slider="homepage"]  

use Slider ( category )  slug and It will work.
